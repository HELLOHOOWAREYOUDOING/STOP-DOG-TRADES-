      <P>Dog and cat traders snatch animals from the streets, steal pets from backyards or buy them from owners. They are crammed together on the back of trucks and driven for days—sick, hungry, thirsty, injured and afraid—then beaten to death or hanged in slaughterhouses or markets.</P>

      <p>Ending Asia's dog meat trade for good poses complex challenges that require a genuine understanding of the situation on the ground and a multi-layered strategy. HSI’s primary focus is on the dog meat trade in China, South Korea, Indonesia and Viet Nam.
        In South Korea, Viet Nam and Indonesia, we have HSI team members living in-country to pursue legislative change and action for animals. In China, we support the efforts of numerous animal protection groups and shelters in campaigning, public education and hands-on rescue.</p>
